            <h2>Objectives</h2><br><br>
            <p>(i) SKART is a purely student welfare website which is dezined by students itself.
                <br><br>(ii) The main purpose of SKART is to bring students of a university or college at a singlr platform so, that they can fulfil each other needs.
                <br><br>(iii) In the beginning taking case of CUH then, CUH is the place where need as well as idea of SKART came in to the existance. Since, buying goods of daily use was challenge at CUH beacuase of it's remote location and limited transportation.
                <br><br>(iv) Online shopping is there which is quite helpful but, there is no zomato in our campus, also there as various small goods of daily use , small electric items, which we prefer buying offline instead of online.
                <br><br>(v) Thus, SKART can fulfil thius need. Everyday someone or the other will go the city (Mahendragarh, here) where goods of need are avaible.
                <br>So, we meet these people who go to the city, to fulfill needs of others also and in return their needs will be fulfilled by someone else.
